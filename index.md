## Research interests

I am a postdoc based at the Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1 in Lyon, France. I am interested in the genetic and genomic processes occurring during convergent evolution in metazoans. My current focus is on the genetic basis of convergent transitions to subterranean life in isopods. Prior to this project, I completed my PhD and a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Queensland, Australia. Here I explored self-nonself recognition and the incredible immune diversity that exists between individuals and between species of marine sponges.
